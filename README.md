# GeauxWeisbeck4's (Andrew Weisbeck) CV Site

This was the very first website I ever deployed that was made with straight HTML and no website builder. I had made websites before with website builders, but never before with pure code. This one will always have a special place in my heart - that is why it deserves to be upgraded. I will be upgrading this here soon and you will see how magical my CV can be!

## Going to be based off my professional CV/Resume - Stay Tuned!

Version 2.0 Coming Soon!
