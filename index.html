    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Welcome to the homepage of Andrew Weisbeck! I currently reside in Raleigh
    North Carolina, but have lived all over the US. I am a Cybersecurity Analyst
    at <em><strong><a href="https://www.ironrangecyber.com/">Iron Range Cyber</a></strong></em> for my full-time job and absolutely love what I do. When
    I am not protecting my clients from cyber threats, I develop web apps,
    design and host web pages, consult clients in marketing and business
    strategy, and hunt bug bounties. I am constantly learning to develop my
    professional career and am currently studying to earn my Comp TIA Security+
    certification for my career.</p>
    <p>I graduated from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 2014 with a B.S.
    in Business Administration and Finance, but that was just the starting
    point in my continued education. Over the last seven years, I have used my
    entreprenurial skills and passion for learning to complete freelance work
    in just about anything you can imagine: SEO Content Creation, Marketing,
    Website Design, Consulting, and much more. My favorite programming language
    is Python and I absolutely love spending time playing around with the Kali
    Linux OS while hunting bug bounties.</p>
    <p>I am not all work though, believe it or not. As for college sportsI am a
    diehard Nebraska Cornhusker fan, adopted North Carolina Tarheel and LSU
    Tiger fan. I also like the New England Patriots, Kansas City Royals, and
    my local Carolina Hurricanes. I love gambling (reasonable amounts of money)
    on pretty much all sports, skiing, spending time with my fiance Lisa and our
    two kitties, Zulu and Beaux, as well as our lovely Australian Cattle
    Dog/Staffy Mix Magnolia. I also love to read, learn, and play around with
    software and technology.</p>
